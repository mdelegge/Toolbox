  "move": "Move a distance up to your Speed.",
  "climbing": "<p>While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and use it to climb.</p></br><p>At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>",
  "crawling": "<p>While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain).</p>",
  "drop-prone": "<p>You can drop prone as described by the Prone condition.</p>",

  "high-jump": "<p>When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance.

Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.</p>",
  "swimming": "<p>While you’re swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed and use it to swim.

If you’re touching another creature when you teleport, that creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the teleportation effect says otherwise.</p></br><p>If the destination space of your teleportation is occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.</p></br><p>The description of a teleportation effect tells you if you must see the teleportation’s destination.</p>",
  "difficult-terrain": "<p>If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement.

Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.</p></br><p><strong>Moving between Attacks.</strong> If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks.</p>",
  "dash": "<p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.</p></br><p>If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your Speed when you take this action.

Make note of your check’s total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p></br><p>You stop being hidden immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.</p>",
  "influence": "<p>With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The DM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary.</p></br><p><strong>Willing.</strong> If your urging aligns with the monster’s desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.</p</br>><p><strong>Unwilling.</strong> If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn’t comply.</p>",
  "magic": "<p>When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated.</p></br><p>If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot.</p>",
  "ready": "<p>You take the Ready action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a Reaction before the start of your next turn.</p></br><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your Speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the zombie steps next to me, I move away.”</p></br><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.</p>",
